    Based on deep learning technology, Tidzam offers unique 
    opportunities for ecological scientists to monitor all over the year the wildlife activity
    in their habitat as well as the automatic recording of their calls. This is a crucial step
    toward a better understanding of animal behaviors in natural environments. All statistical data and
    audio recordings are available online. This system exploits the advantage of 24/7 running machine for audio recording and statistical analysis
    and the expertise of users in order to teach to Tid`Zam about unidentified animal and particular sonic events.
    In such approach, a gamified interface allows Tid`Zam visitors to label recordings which are cross-validated by crowd-sourcing.

      This project has been initiated by the
      Media Lab of the Massachusetts Institute of Technologie for the wetland restoration program
      of a former cranberries farm located close to Plymouth (MA): TidMarsh.
      This restoration programs is leaded by the <a href="//www.livingobservatory.org">Living Observatory (LO) organization</a>.

  <blockquote>
    Our research covers a wide range of questions concerning <b>how former cranberry farmlands respond to restoration actions.
    How quickly does wetland function return to soils?</b> How does ground water discharge change following these actions?
    To capture data on the microclimates inherent in wetlands, some of our researchers
    <a href="//tidmarsh.media.mit.edu/">use small, distributed,
    low-powered sensor devices</a> to stream climate, soil, water and other environmental data on a number of spatial and temporal scales.
    This data is then archived and subjected to rigorous statistical analysis.
    For presentation to the general public, the data is used to populate a virtual landscape;
    users can move across the virtual expanse and time travel in order to explore how different areas of the site respond to
    the restoration actions and to changes in the climate.
